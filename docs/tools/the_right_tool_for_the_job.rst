Programming may be considered a craft (although you can find some debate on
that). If you need to solve a scientific problem that may, e.g., only be
solvable numerically, and there is no software at hand to solve this problem,
you have to write code that does. And as you expect a "regular" craftsman to
know the right tool for his job, you may also want to know your tools for your
job as a scientific programmer.

In the following an overview of the basic tools for scientific programmers is
given, starting with the Unix shell as a mean to interact with the computer
while not relying on a GUI and enabling reproducibility, followed by an
introduction to text editors suitable for programming, and finishing with a
brief introduction to version control systems.
