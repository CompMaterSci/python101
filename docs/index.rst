    "For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing
    them."

    ---Aristotle (around 350 BCE)

Welcome to the Python tutorial of the Institute of Materials Simulation. The
goal of this tutorial is to introduce the basic tools used in our everyday
scientific worklife by actually performing such tasks. We will start with a
brief introduction to the *Unix Shell* in which we list the most common
commands and what they do.
