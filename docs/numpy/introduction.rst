NumPy
=====

NumPy is a third-party package for Python that provides utilities for numerical
programming with Python. It is commonly imported via

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

which maps the NumPy package to the name ``np``. So every time you see some
code with the ``np`` prefix you may assume that NumPy is imported even though
it might not be stated explicitly.
