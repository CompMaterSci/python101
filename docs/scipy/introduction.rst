SciPy is a collection of modules that offer high-level interfaces to algorithms
that are common in the scientific community, like linear algebra, optimization,
integration, interpolation, etc. Covering all the possibilities in a tutorial
is almost impossible, so to see what SciPy can do refer to its documentation_.
