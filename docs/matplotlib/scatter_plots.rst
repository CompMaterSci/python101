Scatter Plots
=============

When your data does not have a sequence but is still characterized by data
points a so-called scatter plot is the plot of choice. The command is
:func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.scatter` and when used like this

.. literalinclude:: ../pyplots/scatter_plot.py
    :lines: 2-

it results in a plot showing the different data point groups:

.. plot:: pyplots/scatter_plot.py
