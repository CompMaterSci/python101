    "The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures."

    ---Ben Shneiderman

Visualization is one of the most important means for the interpretation of
the results of scientific computations. The package that is mostly used for
this task is Matplotlib_.

The ``matplotlib`` package is typically imported via

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

And subsequently all plotting commands are called using the prefix ``plt``.

Rather than exercises that want you to get some results you are shown simple
examples for the most common types of plots.

.. note::

    Producing scientific plots that manage to support your chain of arguments
    in a presentation or publication can not be overestimated. To a certain
    degree it could be considered an art, but there are some best practices,
    e.g., for :ref:`picking colormaps <colormaps>`.
