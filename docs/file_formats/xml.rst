Extensible Markup Language

:Filename extension: ``.xml``

The Extensible Markup Language (XML) format was developed by the World Wide Web
Consortium and is supported by a lot of programming languages. Python offers
support for XML via the :mod:`xml` package.

The `short introduction of the xml.etree.ElementTree over at Python
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html>`_ is well
written and recommended as a starting point.
