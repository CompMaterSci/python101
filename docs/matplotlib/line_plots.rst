Line Plots
==========

The most common plot you see in scientific publications may well be a so-called
line plot. The command for line plots is :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.plot` and
using it like this

.. literalinclude:: ../pyplots/line_plot.py
    :lines: 2-

results in a line plot with both the sine and cosine:

.. plot:: pyplots/line_plot.py
